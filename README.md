Game Details

1. Tic-Tac-Toe
    • Players take turns placing "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid.
    • The goal is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
    • If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game is a draw. To move to the next round, we must have a winner. In case of a draw, players can reset the board using the “Reset” button to play again.
    • Winner gains one point.

2. Pokemon Match Cards
    • Players take turns flipping two cards at a time to find matching pairs.
    • If a match is found, the player earns a point and turn switches to the next player.
    • If the cards do not match, the turn switches to the next player.
    • The game continues until all pairs are matched.
    • The player with the most matches wins.

3. Snakes and Ladders
    • Players roll a die and move their token accordingly on a 100-square board.
    • Landing on a ladder moves the player up, while landing on a snake sends them down.
    • The first player to reach square 100 wins the game and earns 2 points.
